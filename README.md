# Armis-Engine
(⌐■_■)

This is a custom engine built by me to test out lower-level C++ programming. Its main goal will be to power simple 3d games that I want to build. At its core, it will handle simple lighting, texture/model importing, input handling, simple audio events, and other additional functionality that I am completely blanking on.

Even though this is a test project, I will make all the source code public if it is of interest to anyone.
